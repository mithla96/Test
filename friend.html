					About My Friend
				</h2></legend>
					Friendship is one of the greatest blessings that not everyone is lucky enough to have.<br> 
				We meet a lot of people in the journey of life but there are only a few who leave a mark on us.<br> 
				My best friend is one such person who has been able to make a positive impact on my life.<br> 
				We have been a part of each other’s lives for the longest time and our friendship is still developing.<br> 
				Most importantly, I feel extremely fortunate to have someone as a best friend in my life. <br>
				In this essay on my best friend, I will tell you about how we became friends and about her best qualities.

					Our Friendship
				</h2></legend>
				      Our friendship started when my best friend came in as a new admission to our class.<br> 
				      Both of us were hesitant to talk to each other at first, but gradually we developed a bond.<br> 
				      I remember the first time my best friend tried to talk to me; I rolled my eyes because I thought<br>  
				      there was no use and we wouldn’t hit it off. However, to my surprise, we became best friends by the end<br>  
				      of the session year.We learned so many things about each other and found out that our taste in music was so similar.<br>  
				      Since then, there was no stopping us. We spent all our time together and our friendship became the talk of the class.<br>  
				      We used to help each other out in studies and visited each other’s home as well.<br> 
				      On our summer break, we even went to summer camp together and made a lot of memories. Moreover, <br> 
				      we even invented our own handshake which only both of us knew. <br> 
				      Through this bond, I learned that family doesn’t end with blood because my best friend was no less than my family.
